  Starry Night
  Vincent Van Gogh

  1889
  Although The Starry Night was painted during the day in Van Gogh's ground-floor 
  studio, it would be inaccurate to state that the picture was painted from memory. 
  The view has been identified as the one from his bedroom window, facing east, a 
  view which Van Gogh painted variations of no fewer than twenty-one times, including 
  The Starry Night. "Through the iron-barred window," he wrote to his brother, Theo, 
  around 23 May 1889, "I can see an enclosed square of wheat ... above which, in the 
  morning, I watch the sun rise in all its glory."
